        <h1>About PartnerCode.org</h1>

        <div class="about-content">
          <h2>What We Do</h2>
          <p>PartnerCode.org exists for one reason: to help traders find working partner codes for reputable brokers. We got tired of searching for codes only to find expired offers, fake bonuses, or shady brokers. So we built something better.</p>

          <p>Every code on this site has been tested by us. We sign up, enter the code, and verify the bonus actually works. If a code stops working, we remove it. Simple as that.</p>

          <h2>Why Partner Codes Matter</h2>
          <p>A partner code is essentially a referral code that gives you a welcome bonus when you sign up with a broker. These bonuses can range from a few dollars to thousands, depending on your deposit size. The codes don't cost you anything extra and don't affect your trading conditions.</p>

          <p>The catch? There are countless websites promoting fake codes for unregulated brokers. Some codes are expired. Others never worked in the first place. We cut through that noise.</p>

          <h2>Our Standards</h2>
          <p>We only list brokers that meet specific criteria:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Regulated</strong> - Every broker we feature holds licenses from recognized financial authorities (FCA, ASIC, CySEC, etc.)</li>
            <li><strong>Established</strong> - No fly-by-night operations. We stick to brokers with proven track records</li>
            <li><strong>Verified codes</strong> - We test each code ourselves before listing it</li>
            <li><strong>Real bonuses</strong> - The bonus terms must be reasonable and actually achievable</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>How We Make Money</h2>
          <p>Full transparency: we earn a commission when you sign up through our links. This is standard affiliate marketing. The commission comes from the broker, not from you. Your bonus stays the same whether you use our link or find the broker directly.</p>

          <p>This model keeps the site running and gives us an incentive to only promote codes that actually work. If we listed fake codes, nobody would sign up, and we wouldn't earn anything. Our interests align with yours.</p>

          <h2>The Brokers We Feature</h2>
          <p>Right now we focus on a handful of brokers we've personally vetted:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="/avatrade/">AvaTrade</a> - Multi-regulated broker since 2006, offers bonuses up to $10,000</li>
            <li><a href="/xm/">XM</a> - Popular choice with bonuses up to $10,500 and low minimum deposits</li>
            <li><a href="/avafutures/">AvaFutures</a> - Futures trading with TradingView integration</li>
            <li><a href="/exness/">Exness</a> - Known for tight spreads and instant withdrawals</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Questions?</h2>
          <p>If you have questions about a specific code or broker, check the FAQ section on each broker's page. We try to cover the common questions there.</p>
