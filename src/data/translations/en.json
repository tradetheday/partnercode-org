      "p1": "It's a code you type in when opening a new trading account. Think of it like a referral code - it tells the broker you came from a partner site, and you get a welcome bonus that regular signups don't get.",

  },
  "homeFaq": [
    {
      "q": "What is a partner code?",
      "a": "A code you enter when signing up for a new trading account. It links your signup to a partner and unlocks a welcome bonus you wouldn't get otherwise."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is your partner code?",
      "a": "Our featured partner code is 128979 for AvaTrade (up to $14,000 bonus), QK44F for XM ($30 free + 100% match), and 128979 for AvaFutures (futures trading). All codes are verified and working."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is meant by partner code?",
      "a": "A partner code is a unique identifier that connects your broker account registration to an affiliate partner. When you enter one during signup, you get access to exclusive welcome bonuses - often deposit matches or free trading credit that regular signups don't receive."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is the partner code for AvaTrade?",
      "a": "The AvaTrade partner code is 128979. Enter this code when opening your account to get up to $14,000 in welcome bonuses. It's verified and working as of January 2026."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is it free to get a partner code?",
      "a": "Yes, partner codes are completely free to use. They don't cost anything, don't increase your trading fees, and don't change your spreads or conditions. You simply get bonus money added to your account."
    },
    {
      "q": "How do they work?",
      "a": "During registration, look for a field called 'Partner Code' or 'Referral Code'. Put the code in there, finish signing up, and the bonus gets applied to your account."
    },
    {
      "q": "Do they cost anything?",
      "a": "No. Free to use, doesn't raise your fees, doesn't change your spreads or leverage. Just adds a bonus."
    },
    {
      "q": "Partner code vs promo code - what's the difference?",
      "a": "Basically the same thing. Partner codes tend to stick around longer since they're tied to affiliates. Promo codes might be short-term offers. Brokers use both terms interchangeably."
    },
    {
      "q": "Will it change my trading conditions?",
      "a": "Nope. Same spreads, leverage, and execution as everyone else. The code just adds bonus money."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I add one to my existing account?",
      "a": "Unfortunately no. Partner codes only work when opening a new account. Can't apply one after the fact."
    },
    {
      "q": "Where do I find the field to enter it?",
      "a": "Usually on the first or second page of the signup form. Look for 'Partner Code', 'Referral Code', or 'Promo Code'. Some brokers hide it behind a 'Have a code?' link."
    },
    {
      "q": "What kind of bonuses do these give?",
      "a": "Depends on the broker. Could be a percentage match on your deposit, free trading credit with no deposit needed, lower spreads, or other perks. Each broker page here has the specific details."
    },
    {
      "q": "Are these codes legit?",
      "a": "Yes - they're part of official broker affiliate programs. We only list codes from regulated brokers and verify they work."
    },
    {
      "q": "How do I know if my code worked?",
      "a": "You should see a confirmation when you enter it. After depositing, the bonus usually shows up within 24 hours. If not, message the broker's support."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I stack multiple codes?",
      "a": "No, one code per account, one account per broker. Want different promotions? You'd need accounts with different brokers."
    },
    {
      "q": "Do these codes expire?",
      "a": "Some do, some don't. The codes on this site get verified regularly - we show when each one was last checked."
    },
    {
      "q": "Which code should I use?",
      "a": "Depends what you want. AvaTrade code 128979 has the biggest bonus (up to $14k). XM code QK44F gives you $30 free with no deposit. Exness focuses on tight spreads rather than bonuses."
    },
    {
      "q": "Why bother with a partner code?",
      "a": "Free money, basically. Same account, same conditions, but with a bonus you wouldn't get signing up the normal way."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I withdraw the bonus?",
      "a": "Usually not the bonus itself, but profits you make trading with it - yes. There are volume requirements to meet first though. Check each broker's terms."

    {
      "q": "What's the AvaTrade partner code?",
      "a": "128979. You'll see a field for it during registration - might be called 'Partner Code', 'Referral Code', or 'Promo Code' depending on the signup form. Enter it there before submitting. That's what unlocks the welcome bonus, which goes up to $14,000 depending on how much you deposit."
    },
    {
      "q": "Does code 128979 still work?",
      "a": "We checked it in January 2026 and it's still active. Partner codes tied to affiliates tend to stick around longer than promotional codes, which often have expiration dates. This one has been working for years."
    },
    {
      "q": "How much bonus will I get?",
      "a": "It's tiered based on your deposit. Here's how it breaks down: $1,000 deposit gets $200 bonus (20%), $2,000 gets $400, $3,000 gets $600, $5,000 gets $1,000, $10,000 gets $2,000, $20,000 gets $4,000, $50,000 gets $10,000. Above $100,000 you'd want to talk to AvaTrade directly - they sometimes do custom deals for larger accounts."
    },
    {
      "q": "Does the partner code change anything about my account?",
      "a": "Nothing except adding bonus money. Same spreads as everyone else, same leverage options, same platform access, same withdrawal process. The code just flags your account as coming from a partner, which triggers the bonus. Your actual trading conditions are identical to someone who signed up without a code."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I apply it to my current account?",
      "a": "Unfortunately no - partner codes only work during initial registration. Once your account exists, there's no way to add a code retroactively. If you already have an account and want the bonus, you'd need to contact AvaTrade about closing it and opening a new one, but they might not allow that."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is AvaTrade actually regulated?",
      "a": "Yes, and pretty heavily. Nine different regulators: Central Bank of Ireland (where they're headquartered), ASIC in Australia, FSCA in South Africa, FSA in Japan, ADGM in Abu Dhabi, CySEC in Cyprus, ISA in Israel, KNF in Poland, IIROC in Canada. That's more regulatory coverage than most brokers maintain. Different entities serve different regions, but the oversight is real."
    },
    {
      "q": "What can I trade?",
      "a": "About 1,250 instruments total. That includes 55+ forex pairs covering majors, minors, and some exotics. Over 600 stock CFDs from US, European, and Asian exchanges. Major indices like S&P 500, FTSE, DAX. Commodities from gold and oil to softs like coffee and sugar. Crypto pairs with restricted leverage. ETFs. Bonds. Vanilla options through AvaOptions. Enough variety for most trading styles."
    },
    {
      "q": "Minimum deposit for the bonus?",
      "a": "$1,000 is the threshold. Deposit anything less and you still get an account, just no welcome bonus. The tiered structure starts at $1,000 for the first bonus level. If you're planning to deposit anyway, might as well hit that $1,000 minimum to get the extra $200."
    },
    {
      "q": "When does the bonus show up?",
      "a": "Typically within 24 hours of your deposit clearing. Sometimes faster. If it doesn't appear after a day, check that you entered the partner code correctly during signup, then contact AvaTrade support. They can usually sort it out."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I withdraw the bonus right away?",
      "a": "No - there are trading volume requirements first. This is standard for broker bonuses. The bonus acts as trading credit; you can use it to take positions, but to withdraw it as cash you need to meet certain lot requirements. Check AvaTrade's bonus terms and conditions for the exact numbers. The profits you make while trading with the bonus can be withdrawn once you meet the requirements."
    },
    {
      "q": "Which platform should I use?",
      "a": "Depends what you're doing. MT4 if you want to run Expert Advisors - it has the biggest ecosystem of third-party tools. MT5 if you want more timeframes and better charting features. AvaTradeGO for mobile trading - it's surprisingly capable for a broker app. WebTrader if you just want to trade from a browser without installing anything. AvaOptions specifically for options trading. Most people start with MT4 or MT5."
    },
    {
      "q": "What's the minimum deposit without a bonus?",
      "a": "$100 for most account types, which opens the door without committing much. You just won't get the welcome bonus at that level. The $1,000 minimum only matters if you want to qualify for the bonus tiers. Nothing stops you from depositing $100, testing the platform for a while, then adding more later - you just won't get the new deposit bonus on a funded account."
    },
    {
      "q": "Do they offer a demo account?",
      "a": "Yes - free demo with virtual funds, no time limit, which matters because some brokers cut demo access after 30 days. You can practice as long as you want. It mirrors real market conditions so you can test strategies, learn the platform, and get comfortable before risking actual money. No reason not to start there."
    },
    {
      "q": "What leverage is available?",
      "a": "Varies a lot by where you're located and what you're trading. EU clients are capped at 1:30 on major forex pairs under ESMA rules - that's regulatory, not AvaTrade's choice. Clients outside the EU can access higher leverage, potentially up to 1:400 on forex. Crypto leverage is capped lower everywhere. You can usually adjust your leverage level in account settings."
    },
    {
      "q": "How fast are withdrawals?",
      "a": "AvaTrade processes withdrawals within 24 hours on business days - that's their internal processing time. How fast the money actually reaches you depends on the method. E-wallets like Skrill and Neteller hit within hours. Card withdrawals take 3-5 business days depending on your bank. Bank transfers can take 3-7 business days."
    },
    {
      "q": "Are there withdrawal fees?",
      "a": "AvaTrade doesn't charge withdrawal fees on their end. However, your bank or payment provider might have their own fees - international transfer fees, currency conversion charges, that kind of thing. Those are outside AvaTrade's control."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is my money safe?",
      "a": "As safe as it gets with any broker. Client funds are held in segregated accounts at major banks like Barclays, completely separate from AvaTrade's operating money. Multiple regulators audit them regularly. If AvaTrade somehow collapsed, your funds wouldn't be mixed up with company assets. That's the whole point of segregated accounts."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I use Expert Advisors?",
      "a": "Yes, both MT4 and MT5 support Expert Advisors fully. You can run automated strategies, copy trading systems, custom indicators - the whole MT ecosystem. AvaTrade doesn't restrict EA usage. VPS hosting is available if you want your EAs running 24/7 without keeping your computer on."
    }
  ],
  "about": {
    "title": "About AvaTrade",
    "p1": "AvaTrade set up shop in Dublin back in 2006, right before the financial crisis hit. They survived that, which says something. Nearly two decades on, they've grown to around 400,000 active traders spread across most of the world. Not the biggest broker - that'd be someone like IG or Saxo - but they're firmly in the mid-tier with a clean track record. No major scandals, no regulatory actions, no disappearing client funds. In this industry, boring is good.",
    "p2": "The regulation situation is actually impressive. Nine different authorities watch them: Central Bank of Ireland (where they're headquartered), ASIC in Australia, FSCA in South Africa, FSA in Japan, ADGM in Abu Dhabi, CySEC in Cyprus, ISA in Israel, KNF in Poland, and IIROC in Canada. That's a lot of regulatory overhead to maintain. Most brokers manage two or three licenses and call it a day. Your money goes into segregated accounts at banks like Barclays, separate from AvaTrade's operating funds. If something catastrophic happened to the company, your trading capital stays protected.",
    "p3": "Platform-wise, they've gone broad rather than deep. MetaTrader 4 is there - it's what most forex traders cut their teeth on, runs Expert Advisors, has years of third-party indicators and scripts available. MT5 adds hedging, more timeframes, and better charting if you want to upgrade. AvaTradeGO is their mobile app, and it's actually decent - not just a stripped-down afterthought. WebTrader handles browser-based trading without installing anything. AvaOptions is separate for vanilla options. DupliTrade and ZuluTrade integrations if you want to copy other traders. Lot of choices, maybe too many if you're just starting out.",
    "p4": "Their education resources are better than most. Video courses covering everything from what a pip is to advanced technical patterns. Weekly webinars with market analysis. Written guides that don't read like they were machine-translated. A proper economic calendar. The demo account has no time limit, which matters - some brokers cut you off after 30 days. You can practice for months if you need to.",
    "p5": "Customer support operates 24/5 in 14 languages. Live chat usually connects within a minute or two. They've got local phone numbers for different regions. Email responses come back same day, typically. Over 18 years they've collected 60+ industry awards from various publications and expos - Best Forex Broker, Best Trading App, Best Educational Resources. Awards are partly marketing, but the quantity suggests they're doing something right.",
    "p6": "On costs, AvaTrade isn't trying to be the cheapest. Spreads on EUR/USD run around 0.9 pips typically, which is fine but not exceptional. No commission on most account types - it's baked into the spread. They make money on the spread and overnight swaps like most market makers. If you're scalping or trading huge volume, there are cheaper options. If you want a regulated broker with good platforms and actual support when things go wrong, the slightly wider spreads might be worth it.",
    "p7": "The instrument list covers most bases: 55+ forex pairs including exotics, 600+ stock CFDs from US, European, and Asian exchanges, major indices, commodities from gold to cocoa, crypto pairs (with restricted leverage), ETFs, bonds, and vanilla options. Around 1,250 instruments total. You're not getting the 10,000+ that Interactive Brokers offers, but unless you're trading obscure emerging market stocks, you'll find what you need.",
    "p8": "One quirk worth knowing: AvaTrade is a market maker, not an ECN broker. They're the counterparty to your trades. Some traders prefer ECN for transparency, others don't care. Market makers can offer fixed spreads and guaranteed stops, which ECNs can't. It's a trade-off, not necessarily better or worse.",

    },

      "q": "How do I get the $30 no deposit bonus?",
      "a": "Sign up through our link, complete the registration form, then verify your identity by uploading ID documents. Once verification is approved (usually within a few hours, sometimes instantly), the $30 appears in your trading account. No deposit required - it's real money you can trade with immediately. The catch is you can't withdraw the $30 directly, only profits made from trading it."
    },
    {
      "q": "What's the maximum bonus with code QK44F?",
      "a": "The $30 no deposit bonus is just the start. After that, you get 100% matching on your first $500 deposited, 50% on the next $4,500, then 20% on deposits above $5,000. Maximum total deposit bonus is $10,600. So theoretically you could get $30 + $10,600 = $10,630 in bonus funds if you deposit enough. Few people deposit enough to max it out, but even smaller deposits get meaningful bonuses."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is XM legit?",
      "a": "Been around since 2009 and holds licenses from CySEC (Cyprus), ASIC (Australia), IFSC (Belize), and DFSA (Dubai). The CySEC and ASIC licenses are the meaningful ones - those regulators have real teeth and audit regularly. Client money sits in segregated accounts at tier-1 banks like Barclays and UBS, separate from XM's operating money. They've processed millions of trades without any major scandals or regulatory actions."
    },
    {
      "q": "What can I trade on XM?",
      "a": "Over 1,000 instruments across most major asset classes. 55+ forex pairs covering majors, minors, and exotics. 1,000+ stock CFDs from global exchanges. Major indices like S&P 500, Nasdaq, FTSE, DAX. Commodities including gold, silver, oil, and agricultural products. Energies. Crypto pairs including BTC, ETH, and others. More than enough for most trading strategies."
    },
    {
      "q": "What's the minimum deposit?",
      "a": "$5 is all you need to open a funded account. That's genuinely low - most brokers require $50-$200 minimum. It lets you test with real money without committing much. The $5 won't trigger any bonus since the deposit bonuses start at higher amounts, but you can still trade real positions."
    },
    {
      "q": "Does code QK44F still work in 2026?",
      "a": "Checked in January 2026 - still active, still working, still gives you the full bonus structure. We test it periodically to make sure it hasn't been deactivated. Partner codes tied to affiliates tend to remain active longer than limited-time promotional codes."
    },
    {
      "q": "What platforms can I use?",
      "a": "MetaTrader 4, MetaTrader 5, and the XM App for mobile. MT4 is the industry standard - been around forever, runs Expert Advisors, huge ecosystem of indicators and scripts. MT5 has better charting and more timeframes if you want to upgrade. The XM App handles mobile trading well enough for managing positions and placing orders on the go. All platforms sync positions across devices."
    },
    {
      "q": "Do they have Islamic accounts?",
      "a": "Yes - swap-free Islamic accounts are available for traders who need to avoid interest payments for religious reasons. No overnight swap charges. You can request this when opening your account or contact support to switch an existing account. Same trading conditions otherwise."
    },
    {
      "q": "What account types are there?",
      "a": "Micro accounts let you trade micro lots (0.01 standard lots) - good for beginners or testing strategies with minimal risk. Standard accounts are the default for most traders. XM Ultra Low has tighter spreads starting from 0.6 pips but charges a small commission. Shares accounts for stock CFD trading with different conditions. Partner code QK44F works across all account types."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I withdraw the $30 bonus?",
      "a": "The $30 itself stays in your account as trading credit - you can't just withdraw it directly. However, any profits you make trading with that $30 can be withdrawn once you meet the trading volume requirements (check XM's specific terms). Some people turn the $30 into $50 or $100 of withdrawable profit. Others blow it learning. Either way, you're risking XM's money, not yours."
    },
    {
      "q": "How fast are withdrawals?",
      "a": "XM processes withdrawal requests within 24 hours on business days - that's their internal processing time. E-wallets like Skrill and Neteller usually hit within hours of processing. Card withdrawals take 2-5 business days. Bank transfers take longer - typically 3-5 business days after XM processes it. No unusual delays reported."
    },
    {
      "q": "Any fees for deposits or withdrawals?",
      "a": "XM doesn't charge fees for deposits or withdrawals on their end. They even cover bank transfer fees on withdrawals over $200. Your bank or payment provider might still charge their own fees (international transfer charges, currency conversion, etc.), but that's outside XM's control."
    },
    {
      "q": "What leverage can I get?",
      "a": "Goes up to 1:1000 depending on where you're located and your account type. EU clients are capped at 1:30 on major forex pairs due to ESMA regulations. Outside the EU, you can access much higher leverage. You can adjust your leverage level in the Members Area - not locked into whatever you started with."
    },
    {
      "q": "Does the partner code change my trading conditions?",
      "a": "Not at all. Same spreads, same leverage options, same execution speed, same platform access as any other XM client. The code just tags your account as coming through a partner, which triggers the bonus. Your actual trading experience is identical."

    "title": "About XM",
    "p1": "XM launched out of Cyprus in 2009, right when retail forex was exploding globally. They grew fast - really fast. Today they claim over 10 million registered clients across 190 countries, which would make them one of the largest retail forex brokers in the world by client count. Take that number with a grain of salt (registered doesn't mean active), but even a fraction of that is substantial.",
    "p2": "Four regulators oversee different parts of the operation: CySEC in Cyprus handles European clients, ASIC in Australia covers that region, IFSC in Belize for international clients, and DFSA in Dubai for the Middle East. The CySEC and ASIC licenses are the meaningful ones - those regulators actually have teeth. Client funds sit in segregated accounts at tier-1 banks including Barclays, UBS, and Credit Suisse. The money stays separate from XM's operational accounts.",
    "p3": "They've stuck with MetaTrader rather than building proprietary platforms. MT4 is available - it's showing its age but traders know it, EAs run on it, and there's a massive ecosystem of indicators and scripts. MT5 offers more advanced charting, additional timeframes, and the depth of market feature if you want it. The XM App handles mobile trading and syncs positions across devices. Nothing groundbreaking, but it works.",
    "p4": "XM puts real money into education and events, which is unusual. Daily webinars in multiple languages covering technical analysis, fundamentals, and platform tutorials. They also run in-person seminars and expos in cities around the world - Bangkok, Lagos, Dubai, wherever they have clients. The research team publishes morning and weekly analysis. For newer traders still building skills, it's genuinely useful stuff.",
    "p5": "The $30 no-deposit bonus is their hook. Sign up, verify your identity, get $30 in trading credit without depositing anything. You can't withdraw the $30 itself, but you can withdraw any profits (after meeting some trading volume requirements). It's a low-risk way to test a broker with real money. The $5 minimum deposit after that keeps the barrier low.",
    "p6": "Account options: Micro accounts let you trade micro lots (0.01) which is good for learning or testing strategies with minimal risk. Standard accounts are the default for most traders. XM Ultra Low offers tighter spreads with a small commission per trade - better for active traders. Shares accounts for trading actual stock CFDs with ownership-like exposure. Islamic swap-free accounts available for traders who need them.",
    "p7": "On execution, XM publishes their stats: 99.35% of orders execute in under one second, no requotes, no rejections on standard market orders. Whether those numbers hold during major news events is another question, but under normal conditions execution is fast. Leverage goes up to 1:1000 for some account types in some jurisdictions - way higher than EU-regulated brokers allow. Negative balance protection is standard, so you can't owe them money if a position blows up.",
    "p8": "The spreads aren't the tightest in the industry. Standard account EUR/USD runs around 1.6-1.7 pips typically. XM Ultra Low gets that down to 0.6-0.8 pips plus a small commission. Competitive but not exceptional. They're not trying to win on price alone - the bonus structure, low minimums, and education are the draw.",

  "avafuturesFaq": [
    {
      "q": "What's AvaFutures?",
      "a": "AvaTrade's futures trading platform. Instead of CFDs, you trade actual futures contracts. The big selling point: it works in countries where CFDs are restricted or banned, like Spain."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is the AvaFutures partner code?",
      "a": "128979 - same code as AvaTrade since they're the same company. Enter it during signup for the welcome bonus."
    },
    {
      "q": "Why would I use AvaFutures instead of AvaTrade?",
      "a": "Two main reasons. First, if you're in Spain or another country where CFDs got banned, futures are your way in. Second, some traders just prefer futures - you're trading actual contracts on regulated exchanges, not OTC products."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I use it from Spain?",
      "a": "Yes, that's a big part of why it exists. Spain's CNMV banned CFD marketing to retail traders. AvaFutures lets Spanish traders access the same markets through regulated futures instead."
    },
    {
      "q": "What markets can I trade?",
      "a": "Index futures (S&P 500, Nasdaq, DAX, etc), commodity futures (gold, oil, natural gas), currency futures, interest rate futures, and micro contracts for smaller position sizes."
    },
    {
      "q": "Why TradingView?",
      "a": "TradingView has some of the best charting in the business. Most traders already use it for analysis anyway. With AvaFutures, you can place trades directly from TradingView charts instead of switching between platforms."
    },
    {
      "q": "Who regulates AvaFutures?",
      "a": "NFA (National Futures Association) and CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission) in the US. Both are serious regulators with strict requirements."
    },
    {
      "q": "What's the minimum deposit?",
      "a": "Varies by account type and the futures you want to trade. Micro futures need less margin than full-size contracts. Contact them for specifics based on what you plan to trade."
    },
    {
      "q": "Do I need experience with futures?",
      "a": "Helps, but not required. Futures work differently than CFDs - there are contract expiration dates, margin requirements, and settlement to understand. AvaFutures has educational resources if you're new to it."
    },
    {
      "q": "What about the welcome bonus?",
      "a": "Same tiered bonus as AvaTrade. Deposit $1k get $200, deposit $5k get $1,000, goes up to $10k bonus on larger deposits. Use code 128979 at signup."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I use Expert Advisors or automated trading?",
      "a": "TradingView has its own scripting language (Pine Script) for indicators and strategies. For full automation, you might need to connect through their API."
    },
    {
      "q": "How are futures different from CFDs?",
      "a": "Futures trade on regulated exchanges with standardized contracts and expiration dates. CFDs are over-the-counter products where you're trading against the broker. Some traders feel futures are more transparent since prices come from actual exchange trading."
    }
  ],
  "avafuturesAbout": {
    "title": "About AvaFutures",
    "p1": "AvaFutures is AvaTrade's futures trading division. Same parent company, different product. While AvaTrade deals in CFDs and forex, AvaFutures gives you access to actual futures contracts traded on regulated exchanges like CME, NYMEX, and COMEX. The distinction matters - futures are standardized contracts with real exchange pricing and central clearing, not over-the-counter products where the broker is your counterparty.",
    "p2": "The TradingView integration is the main selling point. If you already use TradingView for charting (and millions of traders do), you can connect your AvaFutures account and execute trades directly from the charts. Draw your levels, set your orders, manage positions - all without leaving TradingView. For traders who've built their entire workflow around TradingView's tools, this is a big deal.",
    "p3": "AvaFutures exists partly because of regulatory changes in Europe. Spain's CNMV effectively banned CFD marketing to retail traders. Similar restrictions popped up in Belgium, France, and elsewhere. Futures aren't CFDs - they're a different regulatory category - so they sidestep those restrictions. Spanish traders who got locked out of AvaTrade can still access similar markets through AvaFutures. It's a workaround, but a legitimate one.",
    "p4": "The futures available cover most of what active traders want. Index futures: E-mini S&P 500, E-mini Nasdaq, Euro Stoxx 50, DAX. Commodities: gold, silver, crude oil (WTI and Brent), natural gas, copper, agricultural products. Currency futures on major pairs. Interest rate futures if you trade bonds. They also offer micro contracts - E-micro S&P 500, Micro Gold, Micro Crude - which require a fraction of the margin. Good for smaller accounts or testing strategies with real money but limited risk.",
    "p5": "Regulation comes from the NFA (National Futures Association) and CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission) in the US. These are serious regulators with strict capital requirements and regular audits. AvaTrade's parent company, with its nine licenses globally, provides the institutional backing. Your margin and trading funds sit in segregated accounts at banks, separate from the company's operating money.",
    "p6": "One thing to understand about futures: they have expiration dates. Unlike forex or CFDs that you can hold indefinitely, futures contracts expire monthly or quarterly. You need to roll positions to the next contract or close them before expiry. There's also physical delivery on some contracts (though most retail traders never get near that). If you're coming from forex CFDs, futures have a learning curve. AvaFutures provides educational resources, but expect to spend some time understanding contract specs, margin requirements, and roll dates.",
    "p7": "The welcome bonus structure mirrors AvaTrade - same tiered system based on deposit amount. Deposit $1,000 and get $200, up to $10,000 bonus on larger deposits. Partner code 128979 applies here too since it's the same company.",

    },

      "q": "How tight are the spreads really?",

      "q": "How fast are withdrawals?",

  "exnessAbout": {
    "title": "About Exness",
    "p1": "Exness started in 2008 with a contrarian bet: skip the bonuses, skip the promotional gimmicks, and compete purely on trading conditions. While other brokers dangled deposit bonuses with complicated terms, Exness focused on tight spreads, fast execution, and most importantly - instant withdrawals. They figured serious traders would care more about getting their money out quickly than getting a bonus they'd have to trade through anyway.",
    "p2": "That bet paid off. Exness now processes over $4 trillion in trading volume every month. That's trillion with a T. By volume, they're one of the largest retail forex brokers in the world - possibly the largest, depending on how you measure. The growth has been explosive, particularly in emerging markets across Asia, Africa, and the Middle East where they've built strong brand recognition.",
    "p3": "The regulatory setup is extensive: FCA in the UK (widely considered the strictest), CySEC in Cyprus, FSCA in South Africa, FSA in Seychelles, CBCS in Curaçao, FSC in BVI, and FSC in Mauritius. Different entities serve different regions. The FCA and CySEC licenses matter most for credibility. Client funds sit in segregated accounts at major banks, completely separate from Exness's operating capital.",
    "p4": "Here's something unusual: Exness publishes detailed monthly financial reports on their website. Trading volume, client numbers, withdrawal statistics, company financials - all public. Most brokers treat this information like state secrets. The transparency is refreshing and builds trust, though cynics might say they only publish because the numbers look good.",
    "p5": "The instant withdrawal system is their killer feature. Request a withdrawal via e-wallet, crypto, or card, and it processes automatically. No human review, no waiting for someone in the back office to click approve. It runs 24/7 including weekends. E-wallet withdrawals literally hit in seconds. Even bank transfers process faster than industry standard because they don't sit in a queue. Traders who've dealt with slow withdrawal brokers - waiting days or weeks for their own money - switch to Exness and never look back.",
    "p6": "On spreads, the Raw Spread account lives up to the name. EUR/USD regularly shows 0.0 pips during liquid sessions. You pay commission per lot instead ($3.50 per side on most pairs). Standard accounts roll the cost into slightly wider spreads, around 0.9-1.0 pips on EUR/USD, no commission. Pro accounts offer instant execution with spreads from 0.1 pips. Zero accounts guarantee 0.0 spreads on the top 30 instruments during peak hours, with commission.",
    "p7": "Leverage is where Exness gets aggressive. They offer up to 1:Unlimited on certain account types if you meet specific conditions (smaller balance, no open positions during major news). Realistically, most traders use 1:2000 or below, which is still way higher than what EU-regulated accounts allow. High leverage is a tool - it doesn't force you to use it - but it's there if you want it. Negative balance protection means you can't owe them money regardless.",
    "p8": "Platform options are standard: MT4, MT5, their own Exness Terminal (web-based, no download needed), and mobile apps for iOS and Android. MT4/MT5 support Expert Advisors and automated trading. Nothing proprietary or unusual - they've kept it simple. The focus is clearly on execution and trading conditions rather than platform bells and whistles.",
